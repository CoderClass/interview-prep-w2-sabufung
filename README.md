## iPrep Week 2: Big O and Hashtables

* **Big O Notation**: Describing an algorithm's complexity
* **Hashtables**: Stores data with key value pairs

What you will submit:
- A GitHub repo with this README file (with the boxes checked).
- Create a GIF showing your Interviewbit dashboard (see below) showing exercises you've done.

### Required tasks

**Big O Notation**

- [x] Watch [Big O Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)(8m)
  - 4 Big rule of Big O:
   + Drop no dominate phrase
   + Drop constants
   + Big O of diffrent step is Big O of total step
   + Different input => Different variable 
- [x] Read [Big O Notation in plain English](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/what-is-a-plain-english-explanation-of-big-o-notation) and write down what you learned from it
  - Optimization without a justified cause should deserve that name as well. (BIG Oh!!!)
  - How to calculate/ approximate Big(O)
- [x] Visit http://bigocheatsheet.com/ and think about how useful it could be to you
 Â - Nice site for storing many popular Big O 
- [x] Watch LogN in 5m: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjDR1NBB9MU
  - I have learned that...
  
**Hashtables**
